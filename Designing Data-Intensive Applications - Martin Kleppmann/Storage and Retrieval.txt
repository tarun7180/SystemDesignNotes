- On the most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you.
- Any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated every time data is written.
- A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set. It can tell you if a key does not appear in the database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads for nonexistent keys.
- Introduced in 1970 [17] and called “ubiquitous” less than 10 years later , B-trees have stood the test of time very well. They remain the standard index implementation in almost all relational databases, and many nonrelational databases use them too.
- Like SSTables, B-trees keep key-value pairs sorted by key, which allows efficient keyvalue lookups and range queries. But that’s where the similarity ends: B-trees have a very different design philosophy
-  B-trees break the database down into fixed-size blocks or pages, traditionally 4 KB in size (sometimes bigger), and read or write one page at a time. This design corresponds more closely to the underlying hardware, as disks are also arranged in fixed-size blocks.
- The number of references to child pages in one page of the B-tree is called the branching factor.
- In practice, the branching factor depends on the amount of space required to store the page references and the range boundaries, but typically it is several hundred.
- If you want to update the value for an existing key in a B-tree, you search for the leaf page containing that key, change the value in that page, and write the page back to disk (any references to that page remain valid).
- If you want to add a new key, you need to find the page whose range encompasses the new key and add it to that page
- If there isn’t enough free space in the page to accommodate the new key, it is split into two half-full pages, and the parent page is updated to account for the new subdivision of key ranges
- This algorithm ensures that the tree remains balanced: a B-tree with n keys always has a depth of O(log n).
- Most databases can fit into a B-tree that is three or four levels deep, so you don’t need to follow many page references to find the page you are looking for.
- A four-level tree of 4 KB pages with a branching factor of 500 can store up to 256 TB
- The basic underlying write operation of a B-tree is to overwrite a page on disk with new data. 
- It is assumed that the overwrite does not change the location of the page; i.e., all references to that page remain intact when the page is overwritten. This is in stark contrast to log-structured indexes such as LSM-trees, which only append to files
(and eventually delete obsolete files) but never modify files in place
- You can think of overwriting a page on disk as an actual hardware operation. 
- On a magnetic hard drive, this means moving the disk head to the right place, waiting for the right position on the spinning platter to come around, and then overwriting the appropriate sector with new data. 
- On SSDs, what happens is somewhat more complicated, due to the fact that an SSD must erase and rewrite fairly large blocks of a storage chip at a time
- Moreover, some operations require several different pages to be overwritten. 
- For example, if you split a page because an insertion caused it to be overfull, you need to write the two pages that were split, and also overwrite their parent page to update the references to the two child pages. This is a dangerous operation, because if the database crashes after only some of the pages have been written, you end up with a corrupted index (e.g., there may be an orphan page that is not a child of any parent).
- In order to make the database resilient to crashes, it is common for B-tree implementations to include an additional data structure on disk: a write-ahead log (WAL, also known as a redo log). This is an append-only file to which every B-tree modification must be written before it can be applied to the pages of the tree itself
- An additional complication of updating pages in place is that careful concurrency control is required if multiple threads are going to access the B-tree at the same time —otherwise a thread may see the tree in an inconsistent state. This is typically done by protecting the tree’s data structures with latches (lightweight locks).
